structure ANN
---
---> Structure ANN Development (WP4): This action involves basic research. First, a way to
convert each 3D monument mesh into a suitable representation to feed to the ANN input
layer will be chosen. Two competing shape representations, based on 2D renderings from

multiple views or volumetric occupancy grid will be investigated.


style ANN
 ---
 ---> as structure ANN plus info from archaelogy about how style is found

inverse procedural modeling
---
---> create a shape grammar + shape grammar comparison method

GUI
---
a. style based organization tool (organize monuments based on construction period and style)
b. style and structure based tool (observe monument's architectural parts with different colors to see and compare)
c. shape grammar based tool

usefulness will be measured by:
- qualitative user studies 
- quantitative user performance


free data: 3D warehouse
labeling tool: amazon mechanical turk


Questions:
- where are deliverables of WP3 ? (i.e. user requirement report and annotated 3D monnument dataset)
- where are deliverables of WP4 ? (i.e. structure ANN model and its performance)
- what metrics where used?
- how much time did it need to be trained? where (cluster) was it trained on? 
- what is Houdinin procedural modeling tool? (or alternative Grasshopper-based platform on top of Rhinoceros)
