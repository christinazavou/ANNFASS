### Volumetric
Basically it's the representation of objects in 3D.
in oppose to 
### Multi View images 
which are multiple 2D representations
and 
### Depth map
which is an image or image channel that contains information relating to the distance of the surfaces of scene objects from a viewpoint.

### Affine transformation
a geometric transformation that preserves lines and parallelism (but not necessarily distances and angles)


### Saliency map
an image that shows each pixel's unique quality
Saliency can be seen as a segmentation problem...i.e. categorizing pixels...
