- for 3D object classification:
    - ModelNet40
        - 12,311 CAD models from 40 man-made object categories
- for 3D object part segmentation:
    - ShapeNet
        - 16,881 shapes from 16 categories, annotated with 50 parts in total
        - most object categories are labeled with two to five parts
        - ground truth annotations are labeled on sampled points on the shapes
        - represented as sparse point clouds with only about 3k points for each model

- for semantic segmentation in scenes:
    - Stanford 3D 
        - 3D scans from Matterport scanners in 6 areas including 271 rooms
        - Each point in the scan is annotated with one of the semantic labels from 13 categories (chair, table, floor, wall etc. plus clutter).
