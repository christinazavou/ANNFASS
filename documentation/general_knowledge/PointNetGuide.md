### Transformation Invariance:
motivated by Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs), T-net applied on input and later on features seek to provide pose normalization for a given input.

pose normalization reduces the need of data augmentation (and the network afterwards doesnt have to learn to identify the object in any e.g. size, rotation etc)

*The global feature vector is unchanged for points between the critical point set and the upper-bound shape, resulting in considerable robustness.
