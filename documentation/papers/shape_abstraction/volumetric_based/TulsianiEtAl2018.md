Learning Shape Abstractions by Assembling Volumetric Primitives

(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00404.pdf)


### From Abstract, Conclusion and Images

##### Goal
- be able to abstract a complex shape

##### How
- learn to assemble objects using 3D volumetric primitives
- unsupervised approach


##### My Questions:
1. Fig7: what is 'Voxel IoU based distance'
2. Fig7: what was the training data of this network ? only chairs ? and was it given 3D volumetric primitive labels? as i understand yes it gives labels because it says you can skip chair handles primitives and result is it will learn to not put any chair handles
3. "unsupervised approach"...but input was mesh and output was multiple volumetric primitives ? yes as i understand from figure 10-14
