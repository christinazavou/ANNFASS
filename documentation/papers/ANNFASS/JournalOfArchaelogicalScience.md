Suggestions:
- we can have a page with all papers or useful links and one sentence explaining each one (or sections..)


Questions:
-  3D scanning technology and photogrammetric techniques?
- vector based and orthophotographic visualisationpractices?
- mesh vs point cloud?
- what exactly does it mean "X polycounts consist the mesh model"?
- how did they split the parts of building(step 4)?

Notes:
Close range pho-togrammetry is a measurement technology that canbe used for the extraction of 3D points from theimages, and by extension, these points are usefulfor  the  accurate  3D  modeling  and  visualization.

1.On-site collection of data:
-light is important (need the building with all lightning conditions???)
2.Generation of dense 3D clouds:
3.Post-processing of the produced 3D mesh andmanual 3D modellings.
4.Subdivision of the 3D model into sub-elements. (to be able to label correctly divided building pieces)


Architectural component recognition:
An example feature would be that wallsare connected with other walls, or that a wall isperpendicular to the ground.

Construction period recognition
