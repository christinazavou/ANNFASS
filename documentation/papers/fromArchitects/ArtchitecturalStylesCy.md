Architectural Styles and Ethnic Identity in Medieval to Modern Cyprus
---


### Goal
Show some architectural styles and features which were borrowed and transformed during the Medieval(1191-1571), Ottoman(1571-1878) and British colonial (1878-1960) periods in Cyprus.

Focus on: the British colonial governor’s residence in Nicosia built in the 1930s

Demonstrate how different groups use the same architectural styles at different times for different purposes.

--------------------------

Examples:
- Byzantine domes 
- column capitals
- Gothic mouldings (καλουπια) and windows
- Venetian lions
- Ottoman lattices
- Cypriot vernacular arches
- British coats of arms
- stone camels’ heads
- gargoyles wearing bowler hats
== > Greek? Turkish? Frankish? Venetian? British? Cypriot?

Fact:
- Domes are Byzantine
- pointed arches are Frankish
- broad eaves are Ottoman
- wide verandas are British colonial

-------------------------

example of the French Gothic style in Cyprus was the Cathedral of Ayia Sophia in Nicosia (1209-c. 1350)

‘Ottoman Gothic’ style: Ayia Sophia or Aya Sofya (renamed Selimiye Cami in 1954); Haidar Pasha Camisi (St. Catherine’s Church, 14th century); Ömerye Camisi (St. Mary’s Augustinian church, 14th century); Yeni Cami (a 13th-century Latin Gothic church);

The church of Ayios Michael Tripiotis in Nicosia, built probably in 1690, is particularly notable for its Gothic, Romanesque and Renaissance sculptures incorporated into a new Greek Orthodox setting

The most famous structure which regularly receives the epithet ‘Venetian’ consists of the city walls of Nicosia, built in the late 1560s in the face of an imminent Ottoman invasion.

Hala Sultan Tekke, rebuilt in the middle of the 18th century and again in 1816, is a similar structure with central dome and four smaller half-domes supported by pointed arches, and a stalactite mihrab 407niche (Çuhadaroğlu and Oğuz 1975, 31-5). The dome was to be taken up in the British representational architecture of the 1930s, most notably in Government House

church of phaneromeni:
- door framed in a Gothic manner by stacked colonnettes
- with Byzantine capitals (the top of colonnette)
- the stone is taken from the Lusignan castle (i.e. lusignan colognian period)

The Cyprus Museum, finished in 1907, was in a brownstone version of the Greek Revival style, plus an Ionic porch (βεραντα) in Pentelic marble

The towns and villages of Cyprus saw a huge number of Greek Revival schools built in the 1920s, beginning with the Pancyprian Gymnasium in Nicosia in 1923


old Government House, being largely wooden, built from a prefabricated kit sent from England in 1878

-----------------------

Gothic details which became commonplace in the
Cypriot vernacular from the 16th to the 20th centuries:
 - trefoil windows (on houses, churches, mosques and fountains)
 - blind windows, (on houses, churches, mosques and fountains);
 - corner mouldings derived from stylised colonnettes, (on doorways of town houses of the late 19th and early 20th centuries);
 - pointed arch (on stone-built village houses, in arcades and balconies in khans, monasteries, administrative buildings and houses, even till the present day).

Ottoman domestic architecture got the most frequent transformations. The two most obvious exterior characteristics:
- broad eaves
- a projecting kiosk
became widespread in 18th- to 20th-century townhouses


Some Greek revival influences:
- pediments over doorways 
- schematic pilasters 
- classical mouldings 
(19th-century Orthodox church)
e.g. church of Phaneromeni in Nicosia, constructed
in 1872
- Ionic façades and verandas
(this turned to be the standard townhouse vernacular)


Notes

- In Malta they also have hybrid buildings .. maybe they have some available?!
