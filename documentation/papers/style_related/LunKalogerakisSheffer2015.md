[Elements of Style: Learning Perceptual Shape Style Similarity](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~zlun/papers/StyleSimilarity/StyleSimilarity.pdf)

### Goal
a structure-transcending style similarity measure (i.e. structure doesn't need to be similar to calculate style similarity)

### How
1. quantifying the geometric properties that make humans perceive geometric elements as similarly shaped and salient in the context of style
2. employ this quantification to detect pairs of matching style related elements on the analyzed 3D models
3. collate the element-level geometric similarity measurements into an object-level style measure consistent with human perception

Notes
---
- from fig.3: element-level style similarity criteria:
    - shape
    - scale 
    - dominant curve

My questions
---
1. in fig2 what is Delement(saliency x distance) and what is Dprevalence?
