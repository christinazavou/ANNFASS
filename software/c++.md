Every C++ library has "include" and "lib"

In the opengl files we care about the "lib" folder

".dll" is used for dynamic linking
".lib" is used for static linking

So in my new C++ project I can make a folder named "Dependencies" and in there include the folder "include" and the folder "lib-vc2019" of the glfw i downloaded. (I can remove .dll files if i only want to use static linking)

So in VS i can open configurations, and in C++ -> General i can add an include dependency path ... then i could use in my code ```#include <GLFW/glfw.h>```


Template in C++:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/
The simple idea is to pass data type as a parameter so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for different data types. For example, a software company may need sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining the multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass data type as a parameter.
Templates are expanded at compiler time.
